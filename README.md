# snake-pygame

a snake game made in PyGame, with a high score saving feature that works by hardware, and will save vie username so different username = different high score, and I will be making a website that will have leaderboards to show top high scores of all players when I get time after school or when I get a better computer because my laptop broke today so will update when I get a new laptop/pc and get working on the leaderboard site, but until then have fun playing snake. P.S. arrow keys to move btw :)
